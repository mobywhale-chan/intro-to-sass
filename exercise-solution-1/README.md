# Intro to Sass challenge

Congrats for surviving the Intro to Sass presentation! Hope we didn't bore you to sleep after a long day, and that you are BUMPED to get stuck into some coding! This is the fun part :)

## So what's the challenge?

So your challenge is to build the page based on `screenshot.png`, and of course you need to build it using Sass ;) In this folder, you'll find:
* a supplied image in the img folder
* `index.html` with the HTML all ready to go. This is just to allow you to get straight into Sass and start playing around. Feel free to write your own or modify it to suit your needs.
* a blank `main.scss` inside the sass folder
* `normalize.scss` inside the sass folder. You should import this into `main.scss` as it'll help make browsers render elements more consistently

## Sweet! Can I start now?

Not so fast! Here are a few requirements when building your page:

* Write a mixin that converts font size from px to rem (root em). To help you a bit, the formula to converting px to rem is:

```
font size in px / 16px (Default font size of the html element)
```

If you don't know what rem is, here's a link explaining it:

Tip: you need to write a function with the above formula first

* Create Sass partials to break up your page into different components


* Use the `complement` colour function in Sass to create the hover state of the button (http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#complement-instance_method)

## Ok ok. Can I please start now???

Yes yes you can! Make sure you ask questions if you're stuck! HAVE FUN!
